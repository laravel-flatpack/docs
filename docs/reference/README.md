# Reference

Flatpack comes with a rich set of Form and List components out of the box. Simply define them in your generated YAML files.

This section lists all the available [Form](/reference/form-fields.html) and [List](/reference/table-columns.html) components and their available options:

- [Form fields](/reference/form-fields.html)
- [List columns](/reference/table-columns.html)

In addition to that, you might also want to customize the general layout, such as the navigation bar of your admin area.

- [Layout](/reference/layout.html)
